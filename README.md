## About This Project

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java makes it easy to build highly connected, resilient, multi tenant SaaS applications on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
It enables you to perform outbound requests using various protocols while only writing the business logic.

## Release Notes
- For an overview of the latest changes, please refer to our [release notes](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/v5/release-notes).

## Documentation

## Features

### OData

The SAP Cloud SDK for Java supports OData v2 and OData v4 protocols by offering Type-Safe and Generic OData Clients and the OData Code Generator. 

Popular use cases include:
- Extending an SAP product or service, building a middle-ware, publishing a cloud app
- Developing and publishing an OData service
- Coding convenience and inter-operability 

See the [OData section of our documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/v5/features/odata/overview#popular-use-cases-for-type-safe-odata-client) for more information.

### OpenAPI

We make the consumption of OpenAPI services easy and convenient by providing a code generator that converts OpenAPI specifications into type-safe Java client libraries that work within the SAP Business Technology Platform.

Learn more in the [OpenAPI section of our documentation.](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/v5/features/rest/overview)

### Connectivity

The Destination API provides convenient abstraction for establishing connections to other systems and services with various authentication methods.

Popular use cases include:
- Access destinations defined in the SAP BTP Cockpit
- Define and configure your own destinations
- Perform REST, RFC, or SOAP requests
- Use ready-made HTTP Clients to execute custom requests

Please refer to the [Connectivity section of our documentation](https://sap.github.io/cloud-sdk/docs/java/v5/features/connectivity/destination-service) for details.
