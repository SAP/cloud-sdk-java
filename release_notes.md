### üöß Known Issues

### üîß Compatibility Notes

- The de-facto standard `resilience4j` implementation for the resilience API now included by default.
  In case you are loading a different implementation of the `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy` via the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI), you should use `resilience-api` and ensure `resilience4j` is not loaded transitively.
  Alternatively, you can invoke `ResilienceDecorator.setDecorationStrategy` explicitly in your code.
- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationService.Cache` now enables change detection by default, but can be disabled via `DestinationService.Cache.disableChangeDetection()`. 
  - `DestinationService.Cache.enableChangeDetection()` has been deprecated.

### üìà Improvements

- Improved the resilience module structure.
  The de-facto standard `resilience4j` implementation is now included by default.
  It is no longer necessary to explicitly reference this module in the `pom.xml`, if `resilience` is already referenced or is present transitively.
- Improved the upgrade path from Cloud SDK version 4 by gracefully handling older implementations of `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy`.
  Previously any occurrence of the `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:resilience4j` maven module needed to be excluded (in case it came in transitively) to not conflict with `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:resilience4j`.
  This is no longer required, as the Cloud SDK 4 strategy will gracefully be ignored, if there is exactly one alternative.
