## 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT - January XX, 2024

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases/tag/rel%2F5.X.0)

### 🚧 Known Issues

-

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- The de-facto standard `resilience4j` implementation for the resilience API now included by default.
  In case you are loading a different implementation of the `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy` via the Java Service Provider Interface (SPI), you should use `resilience-api` and ensure `resilience4j` is not loaded transitively.
  Alternatively, you can invoke `ResilienceDecorator.setDecorationStrategy` explicitly in your code.

### 📈 Improvements

- Improved the resilience module structure.
  The de-facto standard `resilience4j` implementation is now included by default.
  It is no longer necessary to explicitly reference this module in the `pom.xml`, if `resilience` is already referenced or is present transitively.
- Improved the upgrade path from Cloud SDK version 4 by gracefully handling older implementations of `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy`.
  Previously any occurrence of the `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:resilience4j` maven module needed to be excluded (in case it came in transitively) to not conflict with `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:resilience4j`.
  This is no longer required, as the Cloud SDK 4 strategy will gracefully be ignored, if there is exactly one alternative.
