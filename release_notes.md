### 📈 Improvements

- 

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- Fix an issue where the same `HttpClient` would be used for different users when using `PrincipalPropagation` and thus could potentially share the same (session) cookies.
- Fix an issue where destinations for the Business Logging service that are created from a service binding (using the `ServiceBindingDestinationLoader` API) contained the concrete API path.
  This behavior caused problems when using such a destination in a client generated with the SAP Cloud SDK's OpenApi generator.
- [DwC] Fix an issue where the `AuthTokenAccessor` would not recognise JWT tokens passed in via the `dwc-jwt` header.
- [DwC] Fix an issue where the current tenant would not be resolved if the `dwc-subdomain` header was missing.
