## üîß Compatibility Notes

- `UriBuilder.build(scheme, userInfo, host, port, path, query, fragment)` has been deprecated in favor of
 `UriBuilder.build(scheme, authority, path, query, fragment)`.
- Deprecate the strategies `LOOKUP_ONLY` and `LOOKUP_THEN_EXCHANGE` of `DestinationServiceTokenExchangeStrategy`.
  They are replaced by the `FORWARD_USER_TOKEN` strategy.
  If there are any issues when using `FORWARD_USER_TOKEN` for destinations that require user tokens, please report them and use `EXCHANGE_ONLY` for such cases.
