### 🐛 Fixed Issues

- The OpenAPI Generator correctly declares `@Nonnull` and `@Nullable` annotations on generated endpoint methods.
- The OpenAPI Generator uses correct camelCase again, when creating methods to _add items_ to a collections.
  Version `5.10.0` used incorrect `addfooItems(Foo)` instead of `addFooItems(Foo)`.
  This is fixed now.
