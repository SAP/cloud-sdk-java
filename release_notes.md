## 5.X.0-SNAPSHOT

[All Release Changes](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sdk-java/releases)

### 🚧 Known Issues

- 

### 🔧 Compatibility Notes

- Change the default implementations of `HttpClientCache` and `ApacheHttpClient5Cache` to throw an exception in cases where previously only an error was logged.
  The previous behavior of logging an error and falling back to creating a new http client granted a grace period to fix the underlying issue.
