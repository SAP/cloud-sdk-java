- Change the `DefaultHttpDestination.Builder` to throw an exception when the proxy configuration can not be determined for on-premise destinations.
  Previously, only an error was logged to give a grace period for analyzing and fixing the underlying issue.
- Change the default implementations of `HttpClientCache` and `ApacheHttpClient5Cache` to throw an exception in cases where previously only an error was logged.
  The previous behavior of logging an error and falling back to creating a new http client granted a grace period to fix the underlying issue.
