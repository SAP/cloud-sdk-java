### üîß Compatibility Notes

- `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform.connectivity.DestinationService.Cache` now enables change detection by default, but can be disabled via `DestinationService.Cache.disableChangeDetection()`. 
  - `DestinationService.Cache.enableChangeDetection()` has been deprecated.

### ‚ú® New Functionality

- 

### üìà Improvements

- Improved the upgrade path from Cloud SDK version 4 by gracefully handling older implementations of `Resilience4jDecorationStrategy`.
  Previously any occurrence of the `com.sap.cloud.sdk.frameworks:resilience4j` maven module needed to be excluded (in case it came in transitively) to not conflict with `com.sap.cloud.sdk.cloudplatform:resilience4j`.
  This is no longer required, as the Cloud SDK 4 strategy will gracefully be ignored, if there is exactly one alternative.
